# Mindful Page - Comprehensive Project Plan

## Page Overview

The **"Mindful"** page (renamed from "Self") serves as the therapeutic mindfulness hub for alcohol moderation, providing evidence-based mindfulness interventions and self-reflection tools. This page addresses the critical therapeutic need for coping mechanisms during urges and ongoing self-awareness development.

### Why "Mindful" Instead of "Self"
- **Clarity**: Immediately conveys the therapeutic purpose
- **Therapeutic Language**: Aligns with evidence-based mindfulness practices
- **User Understanding**: Clear expectation of mindfulness tools and exercises
- **Professional Standards**: Matches terminology used in addiction recovery literature

## Core Therapeutic Principles

### Evidence-Based Foundation

- **Self-Compassion**: Kristin Neff's approach to reducing shame and building resilience
- **Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT)**: Values-based behavior change

### Therapeutic Goals
1. **Urge Management**: Provide immediate coping tools for alcohol cravings
2. **Self-Awareness**: Build insight into patterns, triggers, and emotional states
3. **Emotional Regulation**: Develop skills for managing difficult emotions
4. **Self-Compassion**: Reduce shame and self-criticism in recovery journey
5. **Mindful Decision-Making**: Strengthen ability to pause before reactive behaviors

## Feature Architecture

### 1. Mindfulness Exercises Hub

#### Core Experiences

##### A. Urge Surfing (Primary Feature)
**Therapeutic Purpose**: Teach users to observe and ride out alcohol cravings without acting on them.

**Visual Metaphors & Animations**:

1. **The Wave** (30-60 seconds)
   - **Metaphor**: Urges rise, peak, and naturally subside like ocean waves
   - **Animation Flow**:
     - Wave builds slowly from calm water (0-15s)
     - Reaches peak intensity (15-30s)
     - Crashes and recedes to calm (30-60s)
   - **Breathing Cues**: Synchronized with wave rhythm
   - **Audio**: Optional ocean sounds

2. **The Candle** (45-90 seconds)
   - **Metaphor**: Urges burn bright but naturally extinguish without fuel
   - **Animation Flow**:
     - Candle flame flickers and grows (0-20s)
     - Burns bright and steady (20-40s)
     - Gradually dims and extinguishes (40-90s)
   - **Breathing Cues**: Flame responds to breath rhythm
   - **Audio**: Optional soft crackling sounds

3. **The Bubble** (30-45 seconds)
   - **Metaphor**: Urges are temporary formations that naturally dissolve
   - **Animation Flow**:
     - Bubble forms and expands (0-15s)
     - Reaches maximum size, floating gently (15-30s)
     - Gently pops and dissolves (30-45s)
   - **Breathing Cues**: Bubble expands/contracts with breath
   - **Audio**: Optional gentle nature sounds

### Animation Implementation Strategy

#### Low Engineering Cost Approach
1. **Use Rive for Complex Animations**
   - Pre-built wave, candle, bubble animations
   - Interactive breathing guides
   - State machines for exercise flow

2. **Flutter_Animate for Simple Effects**
   - Fade transitions
   - Scale animations
   - Color transitions

3. **Asset-Based Approach**
   - PNG sequences for complex visuals
   - Lottie files for moderate complexity
   - SVG animations for simple shapes

#### Performance Considerations
- **Lazy Loading**: Load animations only when needed
- **Memory Management**: Dispose of animations properly
- **Battery Optimization**: Reduce animation complexity on low-power mode
