### Stage 4.7: Distinguished Selected Day vs Today Highlighting ✅ COMPLETED

**Objective**: Improve the weekly overview to clearly distinguish between "today" (current date) and the "selected day" (currently viewed date) with different visual treatments.

#### 🎯 Problem Addressed:
The weekly overview only highlighted "today" but didn't show which day the user was currently viewing in the tracking screen. When users navigated to different dates, they couldn't see which day was selected in the weekly view, making it confusing to understand their current context.

#### ✅ Solution Implemented:

- **Today**: Subtle highlight with lighter primary color background (5% opacity) and translucent 1px border
- **Clear Visual Hierarchy**: Selected day is more prominent than today, making current navigation context obvious

##### 📅 **Visual Distinction Levels**
- **Selected Day (Current View)**: 
  - Strong primary color background (15% alpha)
  - Solid 2px primary color border
  - Full primary color text
  - Most prominent visual treatment
  
- **Today (Current Date)**:
  - Light primary color background (5% alpha)
  - Translucent 1px primary color border (30% alpha)
  - Slightly faded primary color text (80% alpha)
  - Subtle but recognizable highlight
  
- **Regular Days**:
  - Light grey background
  - No border
  - Standard grey text
  - Clean, unobtrusive appearance

##### 🎯 **Smart State Management**
