Mara: "I'm glad you're here."
Mara: "Can you tell me your name, or how you like to be called?"
[Input: Text field for name + preferred gender selection]
```

**2. Introduction & Safety**
```
Mara: "Nice to meet you [Name]."
Mara: "We're going to work on moderating your alcohol consumption."
Mara: "This is a safe place, and none of this information is shared with anyone."
```

**3. Motivation Collection**
```
Mara: "Can you tell me why you want to moderate your consumption?"
[Input: Dropdown with common reasons + "Other" text field]
- Health concerns
- Financial reasons
- Relationship impact
- Work/productivity
- Personal control
- Other (custom text)
```

**4. Current Drinking Pattern Assessment**
```
Mara: "Let's talk about your current drinking patterns."
Mara: "How often do you typically drink?"
[Input: Frequency selector - Daily, 5-6x/week, 3-4x/week, 1-2x/week, Occasionally]

Mara: "And on days when you do drink, how much would you say you have?"
[Input: Amount selector with standard drink equivalents]
```

**5. Favorite Drinks Collection (Playful & Value-Positive)**
```
Mara: "Now let's talk about the fun part - what do you love to drink?"
Mara: "I want you to still enjoy your drinks, we're just working on control."
Mara: "What's your go-to drink when you want to treat yourself?"
[Input: Searchable drink library + custom entry with standard drink calculation]

Mara: "Any other favorites? The more we know, the better I can help you plan."
[Input: Add multiple favorite drinks]
```

**6. Schedule Recommendation Based on Current Pattern**

Mara: "Currently you drink [frequency]. Let's aim for [recommended frequency]."

Recommendation Logic:
- Daily → 3x per week (low-impact schedule)
- 5-6x/week → Weekends only + one weekday
- 3-4x/week → Weekends only (Friday-Sunday)
- 1-2x/week → Same frequency, focus on amount control
- Occasionally → Same frequency, reinforce positive patterns

[Input: Schedule preference selector with Mara's recommendation highlighted]
- Weekends Only (Friday-Sunday) [RECOMMENDED]
- Friday Only
- Social Occasions Only
- Custom Weekly Pattern
- Keep Current Pattern (with amount limits)
```

**7. Amount Preference Setting**
```
Mara: "How many drinks would you like to limit yourself to on drinking days?"
Mara: "I recommend [X] drinks based on your current pattern and goals."

Recommendation Logic:
- Consider current consumption
- Factor in health guidelines (1-2 drinks for moderation)
- Adjust based on motivation (health vs. control reasons)

[Input: Drink limit slider with recommendation marked]
