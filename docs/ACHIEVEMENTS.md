# Achievement System Documentation

## Overview
The Drinkmod app now has a complete achievement system that rewards users for reaching milestones in their journey to manage their drinking habits.

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Achievement Model** (`achievement_model.dart`)
   - Defines the data structures for achievements and granted achievements
   - Includes JSON serialization for Hive storage
   - Categories: account, goal, milestone, streak

2. **Achievement Registry** (`achievement_registry.dart`)
   - Central definition of all available achievements
   - Currently includes 17 achievements across 4 categories:
     
     **Account Milestones (4):**
     - First Step: Creating your first goal
     - Day One: Account active for 1 day
     - Three Day Warrior: Account active for 3 days  
     - Week Strong: Account active for 7 days
     
     **Goal Achievements (2):**
     - Goal Crusher: Completing a goal at 100%
     - Goal Finisher: Finishing a goal (any percentage)
     
     **Tracking Achievements (7):**
     - Mindful Start: Logged first drink
     - Early Tracker: Logged 5 drinks total
     - Consistent Logger: Logged 10 drinks total
     - Tracking Veteran: Logged 25 drinks total
     - Data Master: Logged 50 drinks total
     - Week Tracker: Logged drinks for 7 consecutive days
     - Mindful Logger: 80% of drinks within schedule and limits
     
     **Intervention Achievements (5):**
     - Self-Control: Declined a drink when prompted
     - Strong Will: Won 5 interventions
     - Iron Will: Won 10 interventions
     - Champion: 80% intervention win rate
     - Streak Saver: Avoided drinking on an alcohol-free day

3. **Assessment System**
   - **Base Assessor**: Common functionality for all assessors
   - **Account Assessor**: Evaluates account milestone achievements
   - **Goal Assessor**: Evaluates goal-related achievements
   - **Tracking Assessor**: Evaluates drink logging milestones and compliance
   - **Intervention Assessor**: Evaluates intervention wins and success rates
   - Modular design allows easy addition of new achievement types

4. **Achievement Manager** (`achievement_manager.dart`)
   - Main orchestration service
   - Handles assessment, granting, and storage
   - Manages modal notifications
   - Provides statistics and querying

5. **UI Components**
   - **Achievement Modal**: Animated notification when achievements are granted
   - **Achievement Badge**: Individual achievement display
   - **Achievements List View**: Full browser showing both unlocked and locked achievements
   - **Achievements Section**: Integration widget for progress screen

## Integration Points

### Main App Integration
- Global navigator key setup in `main.dart` for modal display
- Achievement checking integrated into goal creation and completion flows
- Onboarding completion triggers account milestone checks

### Progress Screen Integration
- Achievement section displays recent achievements as badges
- "View All" button navigates to full achievements list
- Replaces the previous "Coming Soon" achievement section

## Usage

### Simple Achievement Checking
```dart
// Check a single achievement
await AchievementHelper.checkAchievement('first_goal');

// Check multiple achievements
await AchievementHelper.checkMultiple(['1_day_down', '3_days_down', '7_days_down']);

// Common milestone checks
await AchievementHelper.checkAccountMilestones();
await AchievementHelper.checkGoalMilestones();
await AchievementHelper.checkTrackingMilestones();
await AchievementHelper.checkInterventionMilestones();
```

### Achievement Triggers
- **Account Creation**: Automatically triggers account milestone assessments
- **Goal Creation**: Triggers "first_goal" achievement check  
- **Goal Completion**: Triggers goal completion achievement checks
- **Drink Logging**: Records event and triggers tracking milestone checks
- **Intervention Decisions**: Records win/loss events and triggers intervention achievements
- **Screen Navigation**: Async checks when visiting Home or Tracking screens
- **Persona Generation**: Account age achievements work correctly with backdated personas

### Account Age Achievement Details
The account age achievements (`1_day_down`, `3_days_down`, `7_days_down`) are calculated based on:
- **Storage Field**: `accountCreatedDate` (millisecond timestamp)
- **Assessment Method**: `UserDataService.getAccountCreatedDate()` 
- **Calculation**: `DateTime.now().difference(creationDate).inDays`
- **Persona Support**: PersonaDataService correctly backdates account creation for testing

**Example Persona Timeline**:
- "Mostly Sober Samuel" (90 days): Account created 90 days ago ‚Üí Should trigger all account age achievements
- "Normal Norman" (60 days): Account created 60 days ago ‚Üí Should trigger 1-day, 3-day, and 7-day achievements
- "Drunk Deirdre" (15 days): Account created 15 days ago ‚Üí Should trigger 1-day, 3-day, and 7-day achievements

## Data Storage
- Uses Hive for local storage of granted achievements
- Achievements stored with timestamps and context
- Statistics tracking for total achievements, categories, etc.

## Future Enhancements
1. **Additional Achievement Categories**
   - Streak achievements (consecutive days)
   - Progress achievements (specific milestones)
   - Social achievements (sharing, etc.)

2. **Enhanced UI**
   - Achievement detail modals
   - Progress bars for upcoming achievements
   - Achievement sharing capabilities
   - Visual progress indicators for achievement chains

3. **Notification System**
   - Push notifications for achievements
   - Weekly/monthly achievement summaries

## Troubleshooting & Fixes

### Critical Issues Resolved

#### 1. Achievement Modal Display Issue
**Problem**: Achievements were being granted but modals weren't displaying to users.
**Root Cause**: `GoRouter` was creating its own navigator key instead of using the shared one from `main.dart`.
**Solution**: Modified `app_router.dart` to use `DrinkmodApp.navigatorKey` for proper modal overlay.

#### 2. Account Age Assessment Bug
**Problem**: Account age achievements (1-day, 3-day, 7-day) weren't triggering for personas with older creation dates.
**Root Cause**: `BaseAssessor.getAccountCreationDate()` was looking for a `createdAt` string field instead of using the proper `UserDataService.getAccountCreatedDate()` method.
**Fields Involved**:
- ‚úÖ **UserDataService**: Stores `accountCreatedDate` as millisecond timestamp
- ‚úÖ **PersonaDataService**: Correctly sets `accountCreatedDate` when creating test personas
- ‚ùå **BaseAssessor**: Was incorrectly looking for `createdAt` string field
**Solution**: Fixed `BaseAssessor` to use `_userService.getAccountCreatedDate()` method.

#### 3. Achievement Badge UI Alignment
**Problem**: Achievement badge text was pushing circular icons out of alignment.
**Solution**: Implemented fixed container sizing in `achievement_badge.dart`:
- Fixed width: 64px for badge containers
- Fixed height: 88px total (64px circle + 24px text)
- Consistent 8px spacing between badges

#### 4. Race Conditions in Achievement Checking
**Problem**: Achievement checks were running before user data was fully loaded.
**Solution**: Implemented async achievement checking with 500ms delays:
- `_checkAchievementsAsync()` method with `Future.delayed()`
- Integrated into `didChangeDependencies()` for screen transitions
- Applied to both `ProgressScreen` and `HomeScreen`

### Debugging Tools Used
- Comprehensive logging in `AchievementManager` for modal display
- Debug output in assessors showing account creation dates and calculations
- Storage verification logging to confirm achievements are being saved
- UI refresh mechanisms using `GlobalKey` for achievement sections

### Integration Patterns

#### Async Achievement Checking Pattern
```dart
Future<void> _checkAchievementsAsync() async {
  Future.delayed(const Duration(milliseconds: 500), () async {
    print('üèÜ Checking achievements asynchronously');
    await AchievementHelper.checkMultiple([
      '1_day_down',
      '3_days_down', 
      '7_days_down',
      'first_goal',
    ]);
  });
}
```

#### Screen Integration Pattern
```dart
@override
void didChangeDependencies() {
  super.didChangeDependencies();
  _checkAchievementsAsync(); // Check when returning to screen
}
```

### Data Flow Verification
1. **Account Creation**: `UserDataService.completeOnboarding()` sets `accountCreatedDate` timestamp
2. **Persona Generation**: `PersonaDataService._updateAccountCreationDate()` backdate accounts correctly
3. **Achievement Assessment**: `BaseAssessor.getDaysSinceAccountCreation()` calculates from proper field
4. **Achievement Granting**: `AchievementManager._grantAchievement()` stores with context
5. **Modal Display**: Uses shared navigator key for proper overlay presentation
6. **UI Refresh**: Achievement sections refresh after granting new achievements

## Enhanced Achievements List View
The achievements list now displays both unlocked and locked achievements, helping users understand what they can work towards:

**Visual Design**:
- **Unlocked Section**: Full-color icons with check marks and unlock dates
- **Locked Section**: Greyed-out icons with "Locked" badges
- **Progress Indicator**: App bar shows "X of Y unlocked" count

**Organization**:
- Achievements grouped into "Unlocked" and "Work Towards" sections
- Locked achievements sorted by category and chain position
- Account milestones (1-day, 3-day, 7-day) appear in logical progression

**User Benefits**:
- Clear visibility of all available achievements
- Motivation to work towards specific goals
- Understanding of achievement progression and requirements

## Event Tracking System

### App Events Model
To properly track achievements without relying on schedule violations, the app now includes a comprehensive event tracking system:

**AppEvent Model** (`app_event.dart`):
- Tracks all significant user actions for achievement assessment
- Stored in dedicated Hive box with metadata for context
- Event types: `drinkLogged`, `interventionWin`, `interventionLoss`, `goalCreated`, `goalCompleted`, `accountCreated`

**AppEventsService** (`app_events_service.dart`):
- Records events with rich metadata for achievement calculation
- Provides filtering and statistics for assessors
- Tracks compliance rates, intervention success, and logging patterns

### Event Recording Integration

**Drink Logging Events:**
- Recorded in `DrinkLoggingCubit.logDrinkEntry()`
- Includes schedule compliance and limit adherence metadata
- Tracks intervention context when applicable

**Intervention Events:**
- Recorded in `InterventionService.recordInterventionEvent()`
- Distinguishes between wins (declined) and losses (proceeded)
- Links to specific drink entries when applicable

**Benefits:**
- Achievement assessment independent of current app state
- Historical tracking for complex achievements like compliance rates
- Rich context for debugging and analytics
- Separation of concerns between tracking and assessment

## Implementation Status
