# Achievement System Documentation

## Overview
The Drinkmod app now has a complete achievement system that rewards users for reaching milestones in their journey to manage their drinking habits.

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Achievement Model** (`achievement_model.dart`)
   - Defines the data structures for achievements and granted achievements
   - Includes JSON serialization for Hive storage
   - Categories: account, goal, milestone, streak

2. **Achievement Registry** (`achievement_registry.dart`)
   - Central definition of all available achievements
   - Currently includes 6 initial achievements:
     - First Goal: Creating your first goal
     - 1 Day Down: Account active for 1 day
     - 3 Days Down: Account active for 3 days  
     - 7 Days Down: Account active for 7 days
     - First Goal Completed: Completing a goal at 100%
     - First Goal Finished: Finishing a goal (any percentage)

3. **Assessment System**
   - **Base Assessor**: Common functionality for all assessors
   - **Account Assessor**: Evaluates account milestone achievements
   - **Goal Assessor**: Evaluates goal-related achievements
   - Modular design allows easy addition of new achievement types

4. **Achievement Manager** (`achievement_manager.dart`)
   - Main orchestration service
   - Handles assessment, granting, and storage
   - Manages modal notifications
   - Provides statistics and querying

5. **UI Components**
   - **Achievement Modal**: Animated notification when achievements are granted
   - **Achievement Badge**: Individual achievement display
   - **Achievements List View**: Full browser for all achievements
   - **Achievements Section**: Integration widget for progress screen

## Integration Points

### Main App Integration
- Global navigator key setup in `main.dart` for modal display
- Achievement checking integrated into goal creation and completion flows
- Onboarding completion triggers account milestone checks

### Progress Screen Integration
- Achievement section displays recent achievements as badges
- "View All" button navigates to full achievements list
- Replaces the previous "Coming Soon" achievement section

## Usage

### Simple Achievement Checking
```dart
// Check a single achievement
await AchievementHelper.checkAchievement('first_goal');

// Check multiple achievements
await AchievementHelper.checkMultiple(['1_day_down', '3_days_down', '7_days_down']);

// Common milestone checks
await AchievementHelper.checkAccountMilestones();
await AchievementHelper.checkGoalMilestones();
```

### Achievement Triggers
- **Account Creation**: Automatically triggers account milestone assessments
- **Goal Creation**: Triggers "first_goal" achievement check
- **Goal Completion**: Triggers goal completion achievement checks
- **Daily App Usage**: Could trigger account milestone checks (future enhancement)

## Data Storage
- Uses Hive for local storage of granted achievements
- Achievements stored with timestamps and context
- Statistics tracking for total achievements, categories, etc.

## Future Enhancements
1. **Additional Achievement Categories**
   - Streak achievements (consecutive days)
   - Progress achievements (specific milestones)
   - Social achievements (sharing, etc.)

2. **Enhanced UI**
   - Achievement detail modals
   - Progress bars for upcoming achievements
   - Achievement sharing capabilities

3. **Notification System**
   - Push notifications for achievements
   - Weekly/monthly achievement summaries
