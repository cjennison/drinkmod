# Drinkmod

Drinkmod is a mobile application that allows users to track their alcohol consumption and control it through goal setting, calendars, and rewards. It is designed to help users manage their drinking habits effectively.

# Coding Rules
- You are never to ask to build or run the application. You assume it is always running.
- You are not to use Emojis in coding unless they provide a clear functional purpose.
- You are never to write AI-notes in the comments in the code that do not provide clear functional purpose. Comments must be written as if a human wrote them and intended to explain functionality.
- Files must be under 400 lines of code.
- You are NEVER to create "streamlined", "refactored", or similarly named duplicate files without fully removing and replacing the original files. If you create a new version of a file, you must delete the old version and use the same filename. Do not create file variants with suffixes like "_streamlined", "_v2", "_new", etc.

# Development Guidelines
- You must refer to docs/PROJECT.md for the project development plan. After completing any stage of development, you must update the project plan with the changes made.
